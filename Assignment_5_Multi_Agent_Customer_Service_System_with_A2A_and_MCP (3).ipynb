        "## Overview\n",
        "The goal for this repo is to build a multi-agent customer service system where specialized agents coordinate using Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication and access customer data through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).  \n",
        "HERE IS THE GITHUB REPO for this project:\n",
        "\n",
        "https://github.com/LatifaTam/Multi-Agent-Customer-Service-System-with-A2A-and-MCP-Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "### 0. Conclusion\n",
        "Throughout the implementation of this multi-agent system, several interesting challenges came up. One of the biggest observations was how strict ADK is when handling tools. Any mismatch in required parameters or slight formatting issues immediately causes tool failures, producing noisy errors that can be hard to diagnose. It reinforced how important it is to give the LLM extremely explicit tool instructions so it does not make up parameters or misname anything.\n",
        "\n",
        "The other recurring issue was the NoneType error when reading task artifacts. Sometimes ADK produces incomplete artifact structures during the first execution, which caused the \"NoneType is not subscriptable\" exception. Re-running often resolved it, so the underlying cause appears to be inconsistent artifact generation rather than an application bug. This project also revealed how easily uvicorn processes remain alive in the background, requiring manual cleanup to avoid \"address already in use\" errors. Despite these hurdles, the final system works reliably once ports and tool instructions are carefully managed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Database Setup\n",
        "We start by running database_setup.py included in the github repo to get the support.db, which will be the source database for this project."
